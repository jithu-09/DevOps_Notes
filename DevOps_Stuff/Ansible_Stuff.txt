Ansible
for ssh, icmp rule very important to enable ssh comms to instances. connecting over few ntwks may be problem as may not allow ssh.
solve sh issue for passwordless auth: every restart gives a new public ip for instance, be careful, update inventory.ini, 

inventory file:

stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_password=Am3ric@  ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
~                                                             

playbook:

name: Steps for creating a file
hosts: stapp02

tasks:
  - name: Create a file
    file:
      path: /tmp/file.txt
      state: touch

Ansible’s default config file is usually at: /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
add a sudo user: under [defaults] section, add:
[defaults]
remote_user = <username>


If you're ever unsure about what a module supports, run:

ansible-doc <module_name>
For example:
ansible-doc copy
ansible-doc service
ansible-doc shell
ansible-doc file

playbook to create file and set perms and owner of the file in resp app servers:
---
- name: Create /tmp/nfsshare.txt with correct permissions and ownership
  hosts: appservers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Create empty file /tmp/nfsshare.txt
      file:
        path: /tmp/nfsshare.txt
        state: touch
        mode: '0644'
        owner: "{{ file_owner }}"
        group: "{{ file_owner }}"
  vars:
    file_owner: "{{ hostvars[inventory_hostname]['ansible_user'] }}"


Disable SSH host key checking globally:
add this in ansible.cfg file-
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False


use copy :

- name: Copy Index.html to all app servers
  hosts: stapp02
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Copy index.html to all servers
      copy:
        src: /usr/src/finance-t2q5/story-t2q5.txt
        dest: /opt/finance-t2q5
        remote_src: yes #if file is on target server(where you intend to do the action, ignore if on system you are working on)
        mode: '0644' # to set file permission



---
- name: Create /opt/file-t4q6.txt with specific content
  hosts: stapp01, stapp02, stapp03
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Create file with specific content
      copy:
        content: "This file is created by Ansible!\n"
        dest: /opt/file-t4q6.txt
        mode: '0644'

✅ It will:

Create the file if it doesn’t exist

Overwrite the file if it does exist

Write the line:
This file is created by Ansible! into the file

<<<always check indentation>>

find this out:

a. The Jump host serves as our Ansible controller, and the Ansible playbooks will be executed through the thor user from the jump host.

b. An inventory file, /home/thor/playbook/inventory-t3q2, is available on the jump host. Utilize this inventory file to perform an Ansible ping from the jump host to App Server 1 and ensure the successful execution of the ping command.
ansible stapp01 -i inventory-t3q2 -m ping
stapp01 | UNREACHABLE! => {
    "changed": false,
    "msg": "Invalid/incorrect password: Permission denied, please try again.",
    "unreachable": true


install package:

---
- name: Install zlib package on App Server 3
  hosts: stapp03
  become: true  # Ensure it runs with elevated privileges
  tasks:
    - name: Install zlib
      package:
        name: zlib
        state: present
