Git- underlying tech for managing teams
GitHub - publicly hosted git-based central repo of code
other ex: GitLab, bitbucket

dev -> GitHub -> then to build server -> then tested in test server -> manually shifted to prod server

Manage container deploy, destroy, manage for optimal util - Kubernetes

Infra provision with all pre-config stuff - Automated using IAC tools
ex: Terraform

Post config tool- Ansible

Monitoring- Prom + Graf
