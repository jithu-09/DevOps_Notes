$ git add DevOps_Stuff_2
@zorroborrolol ➜ /workspaces/Dockers-k8s (main) $ git commit -m "devops stuff from cg laptop"
On branch main
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        DevOps_Notes/
        argocd.yml
        deploy.yaml
        deploy2.yaml
        multi-node.yaml

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

why is it showing nothing to commit when i added DevOps_Stuff_2:
✅ DevOps_Stuff_2 is tracked, unchanged → nothing new to commit.
⚠️ DevOps_Notes/ and .yaml files are untracked → Git is reminding you to git add them 
if you want them included in a commit.

n) $ git filter-repo --path DevOps_Stuff_2/DevSecOps_implementation.txt --invert-paths
Aborting: Refusing to destructively overwrite repo history since
this does not look like a fresh clone.
  (expected freshly packed repo)
Please operate on a fresh clone instead.  If you want to proceed
anyway, use --force.
@zorroborrolol ➜ /workspaces/Dockers-k8s (main) $ got this for both

fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories

commit is done, then got thisgit push origin main

-fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
This means the local and remote repo histories are too different (usually happens after 
reinitializing or rewriting history).
 fix:
   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
   # Resolve any merge conflicts if prompted, then:
     git add .
     git commit -m "Merge remote changes"
     git push origin main

✅ Step-by-step Fix Using git filter-repo:
⚠️ Make sure to work in a fresh clone of the repo as required by git filter-repo.

-Clone your repo to a fresh directory:
git clone https://github.com/jithu-09/DevOps_Notes.git devops_cleaned
cd devops_cleaned

-Run git filter-repo to remove the file(s) with secrets:
git filter-repo --path 'DevOps_Stuff_2/git_stuff.txt' --invert-paths
git filter-repo --path 'DevOps_Stuff_2/DevSecOps implementation.txt' --invert-paths

-Force push the cleaned repo:
git push --force origin main

hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not

There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details.

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:


issue?:
Your local branch main is not tracking the remote origin/main.
So when you ran git pull, Git didn’t know which branch to pull from.
fix:
  git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main
  more explictlly:
  git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main main
  git pull
  And after resolving any merge conflicts (if any):
  git push
