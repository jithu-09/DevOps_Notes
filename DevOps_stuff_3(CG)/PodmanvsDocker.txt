Podman vs Docker

- Docker Daemon(dockerd) runs as root user: if container compromised => hacker can gain root user privileges
- It is also single point of failure: if dockerd is down => containers also down

podman tries to solve this:
- It is daemon-less => no single point of failure => one container down others still run, don't run as root user(Secure). Node running docker is also not effected. 
- Podman is an open source Open Container Initiative(OCI)-compliant container management tool from Red Hat used for handling containers, images, volumes, and pods on the Linux operating system, with support for macOS and Microsoft Windows via a virtual machine.
- Podman provides a command line interface (CLI) familiar to anyone who has used the Docker Container Engine. Most users can simply alias Docker to Podman (alias docker=podman) without any problems.
- This makes the running containers created by Podman nearly indistinguishable from those created by any other common container engine.
- They made Podman api compatible with docker => can run same docker cmds, use existing dockerfiles.
- Add alias docker=podman => run same docker cmds => under the hood using podman

#Note:Docker addressed root user mode, can change it.

## dockerfile is containerfile in podman
## podman endores quay.io like docker hub for docker

#Shift to podman is not necessary => docker has superior integrations and 3rd party compatibility than podman.
