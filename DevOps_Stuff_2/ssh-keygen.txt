ssh-add ~/.ssh/NewDevopsKey.pem(above to done to store private key in mem, no need to enter paraphrase eachtime you authenticate using this key)-not needed for pub key as it is not sensitive and anyone can access it.
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/NewDevopsKey.pem.pub -o Identityfile=~/.ssh/NewDevopsKey.pem ubuntu@54.226.148.205: add pub key

if not working then, ec2 connect:

inside instance

nano  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

/home/ubuntu/.ssh

enable ssh from one instance to another, follow this example:(works if both have same pem file at creation)

(on local machine or codespaces, outside the instance)
scp -i ExtraKey.pem ExtraKey.pem ubuntu@34.230.2.120:~/
(This ensures that ExtraKey.pem is copied to the home directory (~/) of the ubuntu user on instance A.)

ssh -i ExtraKey.pem ubuntu@34.230.2.120
(ssh into instance A)

ls -l ExtraKey.pem
(check file)

chmod 400 ExtraKey.pem
(Set permission)

ssh -i ExtraKey.pem ubuntu@<Jenkins-Private-IP>
(ssh to other instance using it's private ip, since both in same vpc, else use public ip)
