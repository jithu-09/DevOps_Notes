Secure s3:

-IAM policies to restrict access
-block public access

quality and reliability of CI/CD pipelines:
code quality- SonarQube
trivy- image scan

branching strategy used while committing code, approval is needed before pushing code to production
deployment- canary, blue-green
monitoring- prom&grafana, ELK

general cicd pipeline:

GitHub webhook -> git checkout -> static code analysis -> build app -> [create docker image -> scan the image -> push to image repo] -> update deployment repo -> cd stage, deploy the app(mostly on k8s cluster)

helm charts for deployment, service, ingress etcetera
