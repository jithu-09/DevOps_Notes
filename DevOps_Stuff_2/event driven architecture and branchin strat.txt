event driven architecture:

- cicd triggered based on push to GitHub(webhooks)
- auto scaling based on load(ASG, replica sets)
- Automated rollback during failures
- infra monitoring and alerts

Image pushed to artifactory or hub - can be used to deploy in all stages(dev, staging, prod)

Can set the execution of stages based on environment using "when"

sudo - regular user with temp elevated perm for few cmds
root - highest privileges, no restrictions
super- users with elevated privileges, synonymous to root user

BRANCHING STRATERGY:

Dev to staging: done in feature branch
PreProd: done in release branch
go live: from release branch and once everything is working as expected, merge to the main branch.
bug fixes: hotfix branch from the release branch and then merge back

some other follow:
same till pre prod
once verified, merged to main line and go live using master/main branch.
