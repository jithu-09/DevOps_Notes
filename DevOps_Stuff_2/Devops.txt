Devops
dev, test, ops, security: involves mindset, processes, tools that enhance speed and quality of delivery, automate repeated tasks for increased speed and efficiency.

teams practice DevOps to increase innovation and agility, improve quality, release faster, and lower cost. DevOps improves delivery efficiency and predictability of the application and services.

Traditional ways-slow and inefficient-causes bottlenecks(Performance bottlenecks are factors that limit the capacity or efficiency of a system or a process. can occur at any stage.) and delays - 
#siloed:isolated from other(processes are siloed in traditional ways)

monolithic apps- deployed as a unit, making changes very hard, tightly coupled functionality	

plan, code, build, test, release, deploy, operate, monitor

Benefits: Agility, improved collaborations, reliability, scalability, security, improved efficiency of delivery

continous deployment-continous delivery + automated production deployment

aws services for devops(exs only):
devs-aws cloud 9, cloud development kits(CDKs), aws tools and sdks: write run and debug code
code- aws codecommit: store and version control your code
build- aws codebuild- complie code, run tests and build release packages
test- aws codebuild+3rd party tools
deploy- aws codedeploy: automate deployment to various compute services
monitor- aws cloudwatch, aws xray: monitor requests made to applications, track metrics, visualize data, identify optimization opportunities
for code, build, test, deploy: aws codepipeline: automate release pipeline.continous delivery service. enables you to model, visualize, and automate the steps required to release your software.
