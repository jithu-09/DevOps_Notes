MCP - what is it?

- Model context protocol
- Why needed? 
  -> S/w engs when need to do bigger tasks: make use of APIs
  -> Use a rest client(postman etc) or write a code to interact with rest api of app via http protocol(std way)
  -> they have context, missing for AI agents => solved using MCP
- How?
  -> Prompt to mcp client - uses mcp protocol - sent to mcp server( dev by app )
- Mcpservers repo: github-mcp-server
- follow doc in GitHub to use it particular server
- when using GitHub mcp server from vs code, copilot is the mcp client not vscode
