Ntwkng

- two machines on cloud, for comms, use a switch - this creates a ntwk for their comms
  - each one is connected to the switch via interface(phy/virt)
  - ip add will be assigned to the machines using the same network of switch => these two steps allows both of them to comm, within the network only not    
outside
 - this outside comms is done through - Router=> it will be assigned with two ips one for each ntwk
 - But this is not enough, you need gateways there will be many routers and systems need to know which router can comm with them
  => on system trying to reach system in other ntwk, do ip route add <dest sys ip> via <router ip in current ntwk>
    - This tells current sys that it can reach the other system via the router 
    - This needs to be done on all systems which need to comm with others in diff networks

or, instead of adding all the dest servers, you can do:
 ip route add default via <router ip> => any unknown dest server, use the router to comm
 - can give 0.0.0.0 instead of default

## all these changes are only valid till restart, to persist them add them to /etc/network_config file

route- c,d to see kernel ip route table

to associate an ip with a name
can do it in : /etc/hosts
<ip>   <name>  => this is name resolution - first checks internal etc/hots and then dns server

- this can get messy when no of servers and names given to them increases
  => DNS server is used for this : Domain name system server 
  - we point our host to dns server
    => add dns server in /etc/resolv.conf
       nameserver      <ip> => it can do all the resolutions from here => only one source to change

=> incase you want to reach servers not present in etc/hosts or dns server?
  - you can point the dns server to the public nameserver on the internet

wwww.fb.com - this is a domain name
here,
. - root
.com - top level domain
fb - is the domain name given to facebook(just ex)
www - is a subdomain => domain can have subdomain and subdomain can have subs and so on based on need

ping, nslookup to test dns name resolution
dig also, gives more details
