Volumes:
tmpfs refers to temporary file storage in RAM, which is not persistent and does not correspond to your EBS volume.
use <lsblk> to get the list all block devices and their mount points, which will help you identify the newly mounted EBS volume.

Errors in Jenkins:
Java version mismatch with build tool(like maven)

ERROR: Error fetching remote repo 'origin'
ERROR: Maximum checkout retry attempts reached, aborting

Insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database .git/objects suggests that the Jenkins process does not have the necessary permissions to write to the .git/objects directory 
-> Sometimes, cleaning up the workspace can resolve permission issues. Retry job
#When Jenkins (or any process) runs a Git command, it interacts with the repository database under .git/objects, because thatâ€™s how Git stores the code history, the actual content (commits, trees, blobs, tags).

Issue with untracked files -> you need to add the untracked files to the commit or ignore them if they are not necessary for the commit. 
ex: 
git add java-maven-sonar-argocd-helm-k8s/spring-boot-app/target/
git commit -m "Update deployment image to version 3"

trigger Jenkins build:
webhooks
poll scm(cron job)
from UI
API calls

GitLab vs Jenkins in cron tasks: GitLab runs irresp of new code commit at the time the cron job is configed to execute whereas Jenkins only triggers a build only if there's a new commit at the time of execution

terraform dependencies:
implicit, based on resource config, terraform can pick it up

explicit, using "depends-on"
