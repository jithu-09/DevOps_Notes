Multi-clusters

Use Explicit Contexts for Safety: If you manage multiple clusters, you can explicitly specify the context when running commands:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply --context=eks-us -f deployment.yaml


Use Namespaces to Segregate Resources: If you deploy to the same cluster frequently, consider using namespaces to isolate deployments:

bash
Copy code
kubectl apply -n my-namespace -f deployment.yaml

The error message you encountered, ARRDATAIllegalIPv4Address (Value is not a valid IPv4 address), indicates that you are trying to add an ELB DNS name (which is a hostname) instead of an IP address in your Route 53 record. Route 53 expects a valid IPv4 address for A records, but you are providing an ELB DNS name, which is correct for CNAME records but not for A records.

Solution
To fix this error, you need to create an Alias Record in Route 53 instead of an A record, because AWS allows aliasing to AWS resources (like ELBs) without using an IP address.
